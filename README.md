# A-Level-Project
This is my Year 12 Machine Learning A Level Project. I have designed a game similar to Doodle Jump and have used the Neat-Python Library to train the player. This is meant to be an educational game to teach people how machine learning works. You can try playing against the AI or someone else, or you can watch the AI learn to play the game.
